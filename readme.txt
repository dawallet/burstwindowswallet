Burst is a digital currency like Bitcoin but efficient mineable with free gigabytes instead of computation power (CPU, GPU or ASIC)!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burstcoin

Everyone with free disk can join mining. It's a truly decentralized and environment friendly alternative to Bitcoin.

You don't need special hardware to be part of the network. 
_____

How to use it:

Install or unzip and start Burst_Wallet.exe

It will take some hours until you can use the local wallet, because the Blockchain has to download in the background. 
You can use the 'Online' Wallet during this time. 

!! All features of the Client do work with an incomplete / unsynced local wallet !!
